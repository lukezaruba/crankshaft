## Moran's I - Spatial Autocorrelation

Note: these functions are replacing the functions in the _Areas of Interest_ family (still documented below). `MoransILocal` and `MoransILocalRate` perform the same analysis as their `AreasOfInterest*` counterparts but return spatial lag information, which is needed for creating the Moran's I scatter plot. It recommended to use the `MoransILocal*` variants instead as they will be maintained and improved going foward.

A family of analyses to uncover groupings of areas with consistently high or low values (clusters) and smaller areas with values unlike those around them (outliers). A cluster is labeled by an 'HH' (high value compared to the entire dataset in an area with other high values), or its opposite 'LL'. An outlier is labeled by an 'LH' (low value surrounded by high values) or an 'HL' (the opposite). Each cluster and outlier classification has an associated p-value, a measure of how significant the pattern of highs and lows is compared to a random distribution.

These functions have two forms: local and global. The local versions classify every input geometry while the global function gives a rating of the overall clustering characteristics of the dataset. Both forms accept an optional denomiator (see the rate versions) if, for example, working with count data and a denominator is needed.

### Notes

- Rows with null values will be omitted from this analysis. To ensure they are added to the analysis, fill the null-valued cells with an appropriate value such as the mean of a column, the mean of the most recent two time steps, or use a `LEFT JOIN` to get null outputs from the analysis.
- Input query can only accept tables (datasets) in the users database account. Common table expressions (CTEs) do not work as an input unless specified within the `subquery` argument.

### MoransILocal(subquery text, column_name text)

This function classifies your data as being part of a cluster, as an outlier, or not part of a pattern based the significance of a classification. The classification happens through an autocorrelation statistic called Local Moran's I.

### MoransILocalRate(subquery text, numerator text, denominator text)

Just like `MoransILocal`, this function classifies your data as being part of a cluster, as an outlier, or not part of a pattern based the significance of a classification. This function differs in that it calculates the classifications based on input `numerator` and `denominator` columns for finding the areas where there are clusters and outliers for the resulting rate of those two values.

### AreasOfInterestGlobal(subquery text, column_name text) (deprecated)

This function identifies the extent to which geometries cluster (the groupings of geometries with similarly high or low values relative to the mean) or form outliers (areas where geometries have values opposite of their neighbors).

### AreasOfInterestLocalRate(subquery text, numerator_column text, denominator_column text) (deprecated)

Just like `AreasOfInterestLocal`, this function classifies your data as being part of a cluster, as an outlier, or not part of a pattern based the significance of a classification.

| ------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| moran        | NUMERIC | Value of Moran's I (spatial autocorrelation measure) for the entire dataset. Values closer to one indicate cluster, closer to -1 mean more outliers, and near zero indicates a random distribution of data. |
| significance | NUMERIC | The statistical significance of the `moran` measure.                                                                                                                                                        |

#### Examples

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    crankshaft.AreasOfInterestGlobalRate(
        'SELECT * FROM commute_data',
        'num_cyclists',
        'total_population')
```

## Hotspot, Coldspot, and Outlier Functions

These functions are convenience functions for extracting only information that you are interested in exposing based on the outputs of the `MoransI*` functions. For instance, you can use `GetSpatialHotspots` to output only the classifications of `HH` and `HL`.

### Non-rate functions

#### GetSpatialHotspots

This function's inputs and outputs exactly mirror `AreasOfInterestLocal` except that the outputs are filtered to be only 'HH' and 'HL' (areas of high values). For more information about this function's use, see `AreasOfInterestLocal`.

#### GetSpatialColdspots

This function's inputs and outputs exactly mirror `AreasOfInterestLocal` except that the outputs are filtered to be only 'LL' and 'LH' (areas of low values). For more information about this function's use, see `AreasOfInterestLocal`.

#### GetSpatialOutliers

This function's inputs and outputs exactly mirror `AreasOfInterestLocal` except that the outputs are filtered to be only 'HL' and 'LH' (areas where highs or lows are surrounded by opposite values on average). For more information about this function's use, see `AreasOfInterestLocal`.

### Rate functions

#### GetSpatialHotspotsRate

This function's inputs and outputs exactly mirror `AreasOfInterestLocalRate` except that the outputs are filtered to be only 'HH' and 'HL' (areas of high values). For more information about this function's use, see `AreasOfInterestLocalRate`.

#### GetSpatialColdspotsRate

This function's inputs and outputs exactly mirror `AreasOfInterestLocalRate` except that the outputs are filtered to be only 'LL' and 'LH' (areas of low values). For more information about this function's use, see `AreasOfInterestLocalRate`.

#### GetSpatialOutliersRate

This function's inputs and outputs exactly mirror `AreasOfInterestLocalRate` except that the outputs are filtered to be only 'HL' and 'LH' (areas where highs or lows are surrounded by opposite values on average). For more information about this function's use, see `AreasOfInterestLocalRate`.
